# HaHa Heroes VMS 
Welcome to my spring 2024 Bits of Good take-home assessment! I've completed levels 0, 1, 2, and 3 using React, Express, and Material UI as my component library.

# Usage
After cloning the repo, `cd` into `frontend` and run `npm install`. Do the same for the `backend` folder. Then, start the backend and frontend with `npm start`.
